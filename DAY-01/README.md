# Day 01 â€“ Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking


---

## âœ… Topics Covered

### 1. What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage.

---

### 2. Types of Cybersecurity Threats
- **Phishing** â€“ Fake emails or websites tricking users into giving sensitive information.
- **Ransomware** â€“ Malicious software that locks your files and demands payment.
- **Malware** â€“ Any harmful software like viruses, worms, trojans.
- **Social Engineering** â€“ Manipulating people into revealing confidential info.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack** â€“ Intercepting communication between two parties.
- **Zero-Day Attack** â€“ Exploiting software vulnerabilities before they are patched.

---

### 3. What We Do in Cybersecurity
- **Protect data** and ensure privacy and integrity
- **Monitor networks** for suspicious activities
- **Implement security measures** (e.g., firewalls, encryption)
- **Conduct risk assessments** to find vulnerabilities
- **Respond to incidents** like breaches or attacks
- **Educate and train** users and employees
- **Stay updated** on the latest threats and tools

---

### 4. Tools/Concepts Introduced
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW):**
  - Advanced firewalls that go beyond traditional filtering
  - Include intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, etc.
- **GlassWire App:**
  - A network monitoring tool with visual graphs
  - Helps track real-time internet activity and potential threats

---

### 5. Three Domains in Cybersecurity
- **Blue Team** â€“ Defensive role; monitors, detects, and protects systems.
- **Red Team** â€“ Offensive role; ethical hackers who simulate attacks.
- **Purple Team** â€“ A mix of Red and Blue; work together to improve security.

## ðŸ“˜ Notes for L1 Learners:
- Understand the **core purpose** of cybersecurity: **protecting digital assets**
- Learn to identify **common threats** and how they affect systems
- Be aware of **your role** â€” whether in attack (Red), defense (Blue), or coordination (Purple)
- Explore basic tools like **GlassWire** to start practicing network awareness
- Always remember: **Awareness is the first step to protection**
